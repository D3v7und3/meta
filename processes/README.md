# Process visualization

We are using [`BPMN`](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/BPMN) to visualize our processes.

All diagrams are created using [`draw.io`](https://www.draw.io).


## Processes

Each process is available to be viewed online:

- [Billing](https://www.draw.io/?lightbox=1&highlight=0000ff&nav=1&title=billing.xml#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fwemake-services%2Fmeta%2Fmaster%2Fprocesses%2Fbilling.xml)
- [Development](https://www.draw.io/?lightbox=1&highlight=0000ff&nav=1&title=billing.xml#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fwemake-services%2Fmeta%2Fmaster%2Fprocesses%2Fdevelopment.xml) (WIP)


## State machines

There are also some state machines to demostrate complex transitions.
We use `UML` and some `BPMN`ish format to draw these charts.

- [Issue states](https://www.draw.io/?lightbox=1&highlight=0000ff&nav=1&title=billing.xml#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fwemake-services%2Fmeta%2Fmaster%2Fprocesses%2Fissue-state-machine.xml)

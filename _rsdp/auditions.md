Have you ever been in a situation when your software project does not work and
you don't know why?

This happens because no one was actually reviewing what is happening.
No one was informing business owners that code quality is low,
architecture is falling apart and not suited for any extensions.

The cheapest way to prevent problems is to prevent them as early as possible.
That's why we recommend you to do auditions **from the very
first month** when the projects begins.

There are two types of auditions we can help you with.


## Audition for business

This audition is required when you as business owner is not sure about how the
project is doing. We will cover the most important things in a one page review:

1. Is code quality acceptable?
2. Will you system allow further changes?
3. How well it works
4. Will you be able to easily change the team in case you need? See what [vendor lock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in) is

Time and cost is fixed.
It is a one day audition.
It costs 30.000 rubles ([click here](http://www.countrycurrencyrates.com/en/convert/RUB/USD/30000) to see the same in dollars).


## Technical audition

This audition is required for the technical teams.
They can learn a lot from it, or just fix some bugs they have not seen for some reason.

We only charge you for the found bugs. No bugs found == free audition.

How it works:

0. You invite us to your project (Github/Gitlab/Bitbucket/etc)
1. You allows us to create issues in your bug tracker
2. We agree about what bug is
3. We create as many bugs as we can in a single day

Why is it helpful? Because we are motivated to find many bugs.
We charge for them.
And you are interested in receiving as many bug reports as possible.

Why is it only one day? Because we don't want your development process to stop.
Our standard bug definition:

1. Bad design decisions
2. Something is not clear from the docs and the code itself
3. Code style issue
4. Not following best-practices

Time is fixed. Bug cost if fixed,
It is a one day audition.
It costs 1.000 rubles ([click here](http://www.countrycurrencyrates.com/en/convert/RUB/USD/1000) to see the same in dollars).

title: "Roles and responsibilities for the project"
---

Each project has several required roles:

| Role      | Description | Responsibilities |
|-----------|:-----------:|:----------------:|
|   Client  |Single user, who represents a client|Monitoring progress, providing feedback, accepting results, providing business explanations|
| Architect |Single user, who represents the project lead|Is responsible for the project success, including: technical decisions, quality, documentation, and functionality|
| Developer |Users who deliver code|Solving given tasks, asking questions, delivering results|

You can always found out who's who by looking at the project's `README`. It will always have the `Client` and `Architect` defined.
So, all other users are `Developer`s. This table looks something like this:

| Role      | Name (GitLab username) |
|-----------|:-----------:|
| Client    |Ivanov Ivan (@ivanov_ivan)|
| Architect |Sobolev Nikita (@sobolevn)|

title: "Dealbreakers"
---

There several dealbreakers for us when we consider a new client.
We will not work with the clients or projects from the following spheres:

1. Anything that violates the laws of the Russian Federation (or any other countries we are working with)
2. Any kind of unofficial religious organizations
3. Any kind of financial pyramids
4. Political parties which believes and objectives we do not share
5. Online casinos, including roulettes
6. Any kind of dating
7. Porno
8. Microcredits

This list does not cover all cases. We may decline a project even its topic is not on the list.

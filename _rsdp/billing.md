We bill for the [closed](https://wemake.services/meta/rsdp/definition-of-done) tasks only.
We bill our clients once a week. In our invoice we include the closed tasks for the last week.

If a client is not paying us for some reason in the agreed period of time - we stop all our development process for this client until the bill is paid.

## Formula

Our billing formula is very simple.

Each task has an estimate. This estimate will never change.
Each person in the team has a rate. This rate can change, all our rate are public.

The result price for each task will be calculated as:

```python
task_cost = task_estimated_hours * assignee_rate
```

## Adjustments

We also take extra 100% for any kind of work we do as a company's profit.
For example, we closed 1 task with the 50$ subtotal cost. The final result would be:

```python
final_cost = tasks_subtotal * 2
```

That's exactly what our clients get every week.

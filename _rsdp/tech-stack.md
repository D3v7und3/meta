Our stack is solid.

We try to stick to it as hard as we can.
We do not work on code that is written in different languages.
Because we can not control the quality of the final product.

We also work with other tools with a big caution.
However, we believe that you should choose the best tool for the job.

## Our stack

We use `python`, `vue`, and sometimes `elixir`
when we need something to handle serious traffic.

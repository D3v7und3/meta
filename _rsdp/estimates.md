title: "Estimates"
---

Everyone once was in a situation when you have to estimate something.
Moreover, some people even start the conversation with the estimation request.

Sometimes it looks something like this:

> I have an idea about creating a chat-bot with natural language processing and pretty UX. How much would it cost me? And how many days it will take?

The problem is it is almost impossible to tell.
Companies that do it either:

- Have done the exact same thing for the exact same client with the same development team several times in a row
- Lie


## No estimates

We don't want to lie. And our projects are never the same.
They differ from simple chat-bots to complex logistics automation.
So, we **won't give you any estimates** at all.

Have you ever seen a project that was on time, scope, and budget? If so, stick to the team that made it. Never let them go!

Here's a funny joke to illustrate the point:

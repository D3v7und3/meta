All our processes explained.


## Structure

- [`wiki`](https://github.com/wemake-services/meta/wiki) contains every process we have as detailed as possible
- `.gitlab` folder contains templates for issues and merge requests
- `./*.md` files contains pages for [our meta website](http://wemake.services/meta/)
- `processes/` folder contains our business processes in the `BPMN` format


## Purpose

This is a source code for one of our websites, which states our internal process to our customers and employees.

We try to make them 100% transparent for every member of a project.
Wait, what? Isn't it suppose to be super secret?

Well, no. We believe that by making everything transperent everyone wins:

1. Clients know what to expect from us
2. Employees know what their work would be like

But what if someone will just copy this process?
We will be actually happy to know that. That's a situation when everyone wins too:

1. Our collegues will have a nice working business
2. We would exchnage our experience in an open manner
3. Clients will recieve a software of high quality

## Our development process

There are only three major things that needs to be managed in a software development: scope, time, and budget. Traditional management technique tries to manage all three components at once.

And the results are [horrific](https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/white-papers/chaos-report.pdf):
- only 16.2% of software projects succeed
- 52.7% of project were 189% of their original estimate

Unfortunately, you can either manage scope or time with budget.
There are different cases: sometimes scope is more important and sometimes [Time-To-Market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_market) is the key.

What suits you best?
- [I just need to get things done](#i-just-need-to-get-things-done)
- [I am very limited in time or budget](#i-need-my-project-done-on-wednesday)

### I just need to get things done

You get as much as you pay.
This can be beneficial for projects with a high level of uncertainty, when a client is ready to invest their time, steep deeply into the scope and require considerable transparency.

"Time and Material" takes the advantage of a casual ticket system where progress and time are clear.

### I need my project done on Wednesday

And you will have it done on Wednesday.
There would be no excuses for us to be late.
But ... some features would be missing.

This approach is called "Fixed Time, Fixed Budget, Flex Scope".
It was widely popularized in the ["Getting Real"](https://gettingreal.37signals.com/) bestseller book.

It might sound frightening at first, but practically it means that all parties care about bringing on a viable and effective product on time, and all the additional thoughts, non-critical issues and nonessential features are left for the next rounds for the sake of on-time and addressing delivery.

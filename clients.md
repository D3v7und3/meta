## How do we work

### We love good code

High code quality is something we've made our mission and speciality of. We do not tolerate letting things slide their way. It might seem relatively expensive, but you get a product that people enjoy and that is easy to maintain through time. No one can guarantee that there will be no unforeseen issues, but we believe the meticulous handling based on the best industry practices results in much less of that and you pay less in the long run.

### We are business-oriented

We do not work on made-up issues or things we just find convenient to work with against your real needs and interest. We develop what helps you move towards your particular business goals.

Basing on best practices.

### We care about the process

The majority of projects worldwide are executed by well-known step-by-step scheme which is sometimes referred as a waterfall model. The progress flows, like a waterfall, strictly through the planned scope until, with some amount of luck, it's done.

This introduces a list of fallacies, which we prefer not to ignore, so let's consider more details.

The very first step of a project waterfall is scrupulous conception and design, which are then fixed in strict Terms of Reference. It gives the confidence in what you get at the end and in what extent. This is exactly what client loves it for.

But when it comes to reality, it usually goes not as perfect as planned. Actually, even worse than that: [CHAOS report](https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/white-papers/chaos-report.pdf) claims that the average success side is only 16.2% for software projects, meaning those that were completed on-time and on-budget. And speaking of the challenged ones, 52.7% costed 189% of their original estimate.

Apart from this numbers, client gets their limitations: the delivery will contain only what is put on paper and not a tiny bit more. So it means that the project does not imply any of the following:
1. Additional requests from the client;
2. Unforeseen issues being handled;
3. Sudden bright ideas;
4. Even sane requirements of reasonability.

This four issues form the majority of frictions between a client and a provider during a project. Apparently you might have already been exposed to them.

### Fixed Time, Fixed Budget & Flex Scope

So in order to overcome the disadvantages of waterfall model, the Fixed Time, Fixed Budget, Flex Scope approach was introduced, which we believe to be the best choice for the projects you cannot leave to float freely on Scrum or other Agile rails. It was widely popularized by Basecamp developers in their "Getting Real"  (2006) bestseller book.

To let you have the gist of it, one could say it discovers the benefits of possibility that you get a project done on-time and on-budget but... with some features missing.

It might sound frightening at first, but practically it means that all parties care about bringing on a viable and effective product on time, and all the additional thoughts, non-critical issues and nonessential features are left for the next rounds for the sake of on-time and addressing delivery.

### Time & Material

It is plain and, moreover, one of the simplest charge models. You get as much as you pay. This can be beneficial for projects with a high level of uncertainty, when a client is ready to invest their time, steep deeply into the scope and require considerable transparency.

Time & Material takes the advantage of a casual ticket system where progress and time are clear.

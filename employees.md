## Developers

Our internal process principles are:
- **We pay per task (please read below).**
- The task rate is not a subject of argument in situ.
- **We work only remotely.**
- You are welcome to combine a full-time job with working on us.
- We exercise sound judgement, so you are welcome to introduce it whenever you feel it needs to be introduced.
- All that is interesting about the project, or might be used more then one time, must be fixed in documentation.
- We do not spend out clients' money on educating our developers.

### Task-based payment approach

We have adopted a not very common but still effective in its way compensation practice based on tasks closed by a person. When hiring, we agree on your hourly rate, and, when assigning a task to you, we set a price for it basing on delivery time estimation and your fixed rate.

So each task has an expressly declared price and every three days your successfully closed tasks are collected and paid for in bulk.

Basically, you have no limitation in how much you can earn, although it works both ways: if you show low performance, you get less paid than you could have been.

### How my initial hourly rate is calculated

The first and most important thing we actually look at while calculating your rate is your open source projects contribution.

So, e.g., we do not care of where are you based or where are you from, but we certainly will be concerned if you have an empty GitHub profile with no contribution. We are all great fans of open source projects, and we presume that people we'd love to work with are kind of the same. Basically,  the point is—if you love to code, you must have contributed somewhere—and if you don't, we would not like to add more pain to your life.

So, please note we do not care of:
- How much you were paid on your last job;
- What is an average compensation level for a developer in the region where you are based;
- Where you are based;
- Age, gender, or nationality.

But we do care of:
- your open source contribution;
- your presence and activity on StackOverflow;
- your competency, and qualification.

### How can my hourly rate be changed

It is perfectly possible, and you are very welcome to increase your hourly rate.

The most important thing that helps us to estimate things like that is, basically, how much of superiors' time you save. By being capable to close complicated tickets on your own, without requesting help of others, you decrease our expenses and we can pay you more.

We also sort tasks into senior and middle ones. If you successfully tackle senior-level tasks without help of higher level developers, after some number of payment rounds (for most of the projects the payment round lasts three days) you get promoted.

Each time you get promoted, the absolute value of promotion also grows.

### What does the process look like?

Summing up the whole thing. First, we agree on your rate. You then receive one task at a time, and get the next once you have finished. If you find essentials gaps in the problem description, you update the status to 'Request more data', and you get assigned to another task.

You are welcome to leave clear to-do's for yourself and the one who will provide the missing pieces to let you deliver on that task later.

### If you got stuck

If you find yourself stuck while delivering the task, but you are dedicated to deliver by yourself, you might first want to try to find the answer by following the XY problem pattern or check if your embarrassment is caused by the fact that task or project environment, such as documentation provided, does not contain some information that is essential for this particular problem, and simply turn the ticket back to us with a request of such information.

If you were able to successfully tackle your problem, please fix the corresponding results in documentation, or amend the project knowledge in some other suitable way, if relevant.

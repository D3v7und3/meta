# Hello, we make services!

[Wemake services](wemake.services) is a group of technology evangelists and simply those who love to write beautiful code. We are dedicated to deliver products of high quality basing on best practices, broad experience and a good portion of common sense. We focus on large, both public-sector and commercial projects with complicated infrastructure, and we care about what we do. 

Our core technologies include, but are not limited to Python, Elixir & JavaScript.

We are generally fond of [Flex Time and Budget, Flex Scope](https://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch02_Fix_Time_and_Budget_Flex_Scope.php) approach which, we believe, allows to achieve the best results when there is an indisputable deadline. We'd love to show that to you.

We also work with fixed scope and budget and flex time, time & material, and even with standard project management triangle. We choose the approach that suits your goals best.
